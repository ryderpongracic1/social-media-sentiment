#### 2. **Cloud-Native GCP Implementation**
- **Serverless-First**: Cloud Functions for auto-scaling compute
- **Managed Services**: Cloud SQL, Memorystore, and Pub/Sub for operational efficiency
- **Multi-Region**: High availability across us-central1 and us-east1
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform for reproducible deployments

#### 3. **Security & Compliance**
- **OAuth 2.0 + JWT**: Industry-standard authentication with role-based access
- **Zero-Trust Architecture**: Defense-in-depth security model
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest/transit with GDPR compliance
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security event tracking

#### 4. **Performance Optimization**
- **Multi-Level Caching**: CDN, API Gateway, Application, and Database caching
- **Database Optimization**: Strategic indexing and read replicas
- **Auto-Scaling**: HPA based on CPU, memory, and custom metrics
- **Circuit Breaker**: Fault tolerance and resilience patterns
